# 100 Days of Python

My projects for 100 Days of Python from Udemy.

Link: [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

I didn't do all the projects, I just wanted to learn the basics and then practice more by working on my IRL projects.

## Notes

- No directory for day 13 because it was about debugging.
- No directories for day 18 - 23 because I wasn't interested in Turtle GUI.
